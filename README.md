# illimat
Unofficial WIP online multiplayer implementation of the card/board game [Illimat](https://www.illimat.com/).

## Getting started
Install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), then run `stack ghci --main-is illimat:exe:illimat-exe`.

Note that there's some files in here from experimentation/working through tutorials that need to be cleaned up. (This is my first Haskell project.)
